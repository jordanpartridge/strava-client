# Resources Documentation

This directory contains resource files for the Laravel Strava Client package.

## Directory Structure

### Views
Currently, this package doesn't include any views. The views directory is set up for future expansion if needed.

## Future Development

While the package currently doesn't include any views, this structure allows for future additions such as:

1. **Status Pages**: Views for displaying connection status
2. **Configuration UI**: Admin UI for configuring Strava integration
3. **Activity Display**: Templates for displaying Strava activities

## Adding Custom Views

If you want to customize how the package works with views, you can:

1. Create your own views in your application
2. Use Laravel's view overriding functionality to replace any views that might be added in the future

## Assets

The package doesn't currently include any assets like JavaScript or CSS. If added in the future, they would be placed in the appropriate subdirectories:

- `resources/js/` - JavaScript files
- `resources/css/` - CSS files
