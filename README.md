This package reflects my belief that developer tools should be both powerful and pleasant to use. Built with Laravel best practices and a focus on developer experience.

## ‚ú® Why Choose This Package?

- üîå **True Plug & Play**: OAuth flow that just works, because you shouldn't need a degree in authentication
- üîÑ **Intelligent Token Handling**: Automatic refresh handling - set it and forget it
- üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Activity Ready**: Fetch athlete activities with eloquent simplicity
- üîí **Security First**: Encrypted token storage and robust error handling out of the box
- üéØ **Laravel Native**: Built the way Laravel packages should be
- üì¶ **Production Ready**: Scales from personal projects to multi-user applications

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install the package

```bash
composer require jordanpartridge/strava-client
```

### 2. Run the installer

```bash
php artisan strava-client:install
```

### 3. Set up your User model

Add the `HasStravaTokens` trait and `HasStravaToken` interface to your User model:

```php
use JordanPartridge\StravaClient\Contracts\HasStravaToken;
use JordanPartridge\StravaClient\Concerns\HasStravaTokens;

class User extends Authenticatable implements HasStravaToken
{
    use HasStravaTokens;
}
```

### 4. Add your Strava credentials to `.env`

```env
STRAVA_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

### 5. Connect to Strava

Visit `/strava/authorize` as an authenticated user to start the OAuth flow.

### 6. Start building!

```php
use JordanPartridge\StravaClient\Facades\StravaClient;

// Clean, intuitive API for fetching activities
$activities = StravaClient::activityForAthlete(page: 1, per_page: 10);

// Direct access to specific activities
$activity = StravaClient::getActivity($activityId);
```

## üîÑ Behind the Scenes

The package handles all the complex OAuth interactions so you don't have to:

1. Secure authorization initiation via `/strava/authorize`
2. Automated OAuth callback processing
3. Encrypted token storage
4. Automatic token refresh handling
5. Clean user token associations

## üîß Configuration

Fine-tune the package behavior through `config/strava-client.php`:

```php
return [
    // Customize the Strava access scope
    'scope' => env('STRAVA_CLIENT_SCOPE', 'read,activity:read_all'),
    
    // Adjust token refresh behavior
    'max_refresh_attempts' => env('STRAVA_CLIENT_MAX_REFRESH_ATTEMPTS', 3),
    
    // Set your post-connection redirect
    'redirect_after_connect' => env('STRAVA_CLIENT_REDIRECT_AFTER_CONNECT', '/admin'),
];
```

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Professional Error Handling

Handle API interactions with confidence using custom exception types:

```php
use JordanPartridge\StravaClient\Exceptions\Request\BadRequestException;
use JordanPartridge\StravaClient\Exceptions\Request\RateLimitExceededException;
use JordanPartridge\StravaClient\Exceptions\Request\ResourceNotFoundException;

try {
    $activity = StravaClient::getActivity($id);
} catch (BadRequestException $e) {
    // Handle malformed requests
} catch (RateLimitExceededException $e) {
    // Handle API rate limits
} catch (ResourceNotFoundException $e) {
    // Handle missing activities
}
```
